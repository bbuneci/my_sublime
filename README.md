MySublime
=========

This is my Sublime Text 2 configuration based on post of @kennethreitz ,and my
goal is try to optimize the python experience and better support
to web2py[1].

It's a compilation of better plugins tht include:
    - git support(commands and diff view)
    - pep8 autoformat
    - html helper(awesome!)
    - markdown preview
    - inline notation for syntax errors in many languages
    - nice snippets...very nice
    - json auto-formatter

##Instalation

`python setup.py`

##Requirements
- Python 2.7
- Ubuntu (only support yet)

ps: some packages will be intalled with this script to create a better
enviroment

TODO:

    [ ] integration with other OS(include other distros).

    [ ] many snippets for web2py

    [ ] auto update plugins

    [ ] Test script in earlier versions of python
